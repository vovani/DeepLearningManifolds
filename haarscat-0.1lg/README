Installation
============

In MATLAB, type `make_wmatch'.

On Unix/Linux systems, pre-built binary files are already in the directory `./max_wmatch_matlab'.
We provide binary files only for 64bit MATLAB.

Usage
=====

matlab >> [s, meta] = haar_scat(x, perm_vec, options)

		  Input:
	      	 x - A d*N array. Each column is a data sample.
		     perm_vec - Permutation vector.
		     options - M: Computation up to the scattering order M.
       				 - J: Largest scale.
  		  Output:
  		     s - Scattering coefficients, an array of size n_grp * n_path * N, where
     			 n_grp = floor(d/2^J), n_path = \sum_0^M \binom{J}{M}. It is a 2D
            	 array if either n_grp or n_path is 1.
             meta - m: n_path*1 array, giving the scattering order of each coefficient.
		          - path: n_path*J array, each row is a scattering path corresponding 
             		      to each coefficient.
             		     
matlab >> perm_vec = haar_tree_learn(x, options)

		  Input:
          	 x - A d*N array. Each col is a data sample.
			 options - pnorm: the norm used to compute the distance.
          			 - J: the largest scale.
		  Output:
			 perm_vec - Permutation vector, indicating the binary tree structure
              			learnt from pairing, up to a "left/right" switch at each 
			            bifurcation.
			            
matlab >> perm_vec = haar_tree_2d_image_grid(dim1, dim2, options)

		  Input:
		  	 dim1, dim2 - the dimension of an image grid
			 options - direction: the direction of the initial pairing,
                      'h' (horizontal) or 'v' (vertical).
          Output:
		     perm_vec - Permutation vector, indicating the binary tree structure
          			    from a 2d image grid.
          			    
matlab >> [s, meta]  = haar_scat_2d_image_grid_multishift(x, N_shift, options)

 		  Input:
		     x - A dim1*dim2*N 3D array. N sample images.
		     N_shift - Number of shifts.
		     options - M: Computation up to the scattering order M.
          			 - J: Largest scale.
		  Output:
		     s - Averaged scattering coefficients, an array of size n_grp * n_path * N, where
          		 n_grp = floor(d/2^J), n_path = \sum_0^M \binom{J}{M}. It is a 2D
	             array if either n_grp or n_path is 1.
		     meta - m: n_path*1 array, giving the scattering order of each coefficient.
		          - path: n_path*J array, each row is a scattering path corresponding 
          			      to each coefficient.
          			      
Demos
=====

We provide demos for performing classifications on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using Haar scattering
with known image geometry: `demo_mnist_2d_image_grid.m' and `demo_cifar10_2d_image_grid.m'.

We also provide classification demos using learnt Haar scattering on scrambled MNIST,
scrambled CIFAR-10 and MNIST projected on a 3D sphere: `demo_mnist_learn.m', 
`demo_cifar10_learn.m' and `demo_mnist_sphere_learn.m'.

The data sets are available from the following links:
MNIST: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
CIFAR: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Note that the classification step requires the LIBSVM library. 
(See http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)
On Unix/Linux systems, pre-built binary files for 64bit MATLAB are already in the directory 
`./classification'. In order to distinguish LIBSVM functions from the SVM functions in 
MATLAB Statistics Toolbox, we changed the function names 'svmtrain' and 'svmpredict' to 
'libsvmtrain' and 'libsvmpredict'.
