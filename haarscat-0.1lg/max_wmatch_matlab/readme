-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Match_C.shell file contains a program, written in C, for finding 
MAXIMUM-WEIGHT MATCHING for UNDIRECTED graphs.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This program was written by Ed Rothberg to implement H. Gabow's N-cubed 
weighted matching algorithm, as described in his Ph.D. thesis 
"Implementation of Algorithms for Maximum Matching on Nonbipartite Graphs" 
Stanford University, 1973.  


MAIN PROGRAMS:
		- wmatch

REQUIRED FILES:
		README input.form output.form makefile graphtypes.h glib.c pairs.c
		term.c pointer.c readgraph.c unpairs.c match.defs wmatch.c main.c

TO GET THESE FILES:
        Run the "match_c.shell" file in the /bin/sh shell. 
		(It will unwrap itself.)
		Or copy the files themselves.

HOW TO MAKE THE PROBLEM-SOLVERS:

		wmatch:  Solves maximum matching for undirected graphs 
			presented in an adjacency-list format. 

		  Requires:graphtypes.h glib.c pairs.c term.c pointer.c 
		   readgraph.c unpairs.c match.defs wmatch.c main.c makefile 
 		
		       To compile: $make
		       To invoke: $wmatch input_file >output_file
		
		      If no filename is given, a small help message 
                      appears. It always  writes to standard out.  

FILE DESCRIPTIONS: 
		input.form:  Describes the input formats for match.
		output.form: Describes output formats for match.
		test.in:  A sample input for wmatch
	
                edge_to_wm:  A shell file which converts files in DIMACS 
                      .edge format to one compatible with wmatch.  It
                      uses the following awk files. 
                                  double.a
                                  strip.a 

                       Usage:  $edge_to_wm  input.edge output.wm 
      		
               The others are source code files written in C language.
