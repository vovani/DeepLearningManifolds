Disclaimer: the following description was obtained  by inspection of the
code and some simple tests.  It was not written by the implementor.  CCM

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT FORMAT FOR WMATCH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Graph I/O is performed by a generic graph library package, 
   so some of the fields are ignored by the "wmatch" code (but 
   you must include dummy fields in the input). 

   There are three types of lines: the first line, vertex lines, 
   and edge lines. The fields in each line type are as follows. 

   First line-> size edges U
      size: integer giving number of vertices
      edges: integer giving number of edges 
      U: character ``U'' or ``u'' specifying an undirected graph

   Vertex lines->  degree vlabel xcoord ycoord
      degree: edge degree of the vertex
      vlabel: vertex label (ignored--vertices are referred to by index)
      xcoord: integer x-coordinate location (ignored)
      ycoord: integer y-coordinate location (ignored) 

      *****Each vertex line is followed immediately by the lines 
      for all its adjacent edges (thus each edge appears twice, 
      once for each vertex).******

   Edge lines-> adjacent  weight
      adjacent: index (not vlabel) of the adjacent vertex
      weight: integer edge weight
