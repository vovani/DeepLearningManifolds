%SPHMULTIPLICATION Computes coefficients of a product spherical function
%   
%   The coefficients of a product function of two spherical functions can
%   be given directly as a linear combination of the coefficients of the
%   original functions, by employing Gaunt coefficients
%
%   a_nm: (N+1)^2 coefficients of spherical function a(\theta,\phi)
%   b_nm: (N+1)^2 coefficients of spherical function b(\theta,\phi)
%
%   c_nm:  (N+1)^2 coefficients of the product function 
%           c(\theta,\phi) = a(\theta,\phi)*b(\theta,\phi)
