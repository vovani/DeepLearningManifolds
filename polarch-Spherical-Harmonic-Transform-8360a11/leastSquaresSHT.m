%LEASTSQUARESSHT Spherical harmonic transform of F using least-squares
%
%   N:  maximum order of transform
%   F:  the spherical function evaluated at K directions 'dirs'
%       if F is a KxM matrix then the transform is applied to each column
%       of F, and returns the coefficients at each column of F_N
%       respectively
%   dirs:   [azimuth1 inclination1; ...; azimuthK inclinationK] angles in 
%           rads for each evaluation point, where inclination is the polar 
%           angle from zenith: inclination = pi/2-elevation
%   basisType:  'complex' or 'real' spherical harmonics
%   weights:    vector of K weights for each direction, for weighted
%               least-squares
