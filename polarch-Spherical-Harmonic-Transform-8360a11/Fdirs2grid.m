function Wgrid = Fdirs2grid(W, aziRes, polarRes, CLOSED)
%FDIRS2GRID Replicate vector function values on a regular grid
%
%   Fdirs2grid takes a vector of values of function evaluated at a 
%   spherical grid with the grid2dirs function, and convert it back to a 
%   2D grid. Useful for plotting with functions such as surf, or for 
%   numerical integration numerically spherical functions.
%
%   W:  column vector of function values evaluated at each grid direction,
%       with the direction ordering given by grid2dirs. If W is a matrix
%       then each column is considered as a separate function to be
%       converted
%   aziRes: azimuth resolution of the grid in degrees (should be the same
%           as the one used in the grid2dirs function
%   polarRes:   inclination resolution of the grid in degrees (should be 
%               the same as the one used in the grid2dirs function
%   CLOSED: {0,1} if true then the returned matrix replicates the first
%           column of function values at 0deg azimuth also at 360deg,
%           useful for 3D plotting so that the shape does not have a
%           hole in the end (see plotSphFunction test script)
%
%   Wgrid:  if W is a vector then Wgrid is the 2D matrix of the function
%           values replicated on the grid points. If W is a matrix, then
%           Wgrid is a 3D matrix with one grid per column of W, on the 3rd
%           dimension.
