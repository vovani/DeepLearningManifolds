function [xyz] = unitSph2cart(aziElev)
%UNITSPH2CART Get coordinates of unit vectors from azimuth-elevation
%   Similar to sph2cart, assuming unit vectors and using matrices for the 
%   inputs and outputs, instead of separate vectors of coordinates. More
%   convenient for many of the SH functions found here.
