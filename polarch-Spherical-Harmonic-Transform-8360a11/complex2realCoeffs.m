function R_N = complex2realCoeffs(C_N)
%COMPLEX2REALCOEFFS Convert SH coeffs from the complex to real basis
%   
%   Converts the vector of (N+1)^2xK SH coefficients of K functions on the
%   complex SH base, to the respective ones of the real SH base. For
%   normalisations and conventions used here for each base see the README
%   file.
