%GETFLIEGENODES Returns the spherical coordinates of Fliege-Maier nodes
%
%   GETFLIEGENODES returns the unit vectors, the spherical coordinates
%   and the weights of Fliege-MAier sets of points on the sphere for low-error
%   integration of spherical functions. The points can be used for integration 
%   through direct summation of the function evaluated at these points, and 
%   weighted with the respective weights. Each set is appropriate for spherical  
%   harmonic transform of order N = order+1, where order is the number of
%   the set. Up to N = 29 SHT is supported. The spherical coordinates are 
%   given in the [azi1 elev1; azi2 elev2; ...; aziQ elevQ] convention.
