function T_c2r = complex2realSHMtx(N)
%COMPLEX2REALSHMTX Returns transformation matrix of complex to rel SH
%   
%   Returns the unitary transformation matrix T_c2r the expresses the real  
%   spherical harmonics with respect to the complex ones, so that 
%   r_N = T_c2r * y_N, where r_N and y_N is are the real and complex SH
%   vectors respectively, with all SHs up to order N included. For
%   normalisations and conventions used here for each base see the README
%   file.

%   T_c2r:  (N+1)^2 x (N+1)^2 basis transformation matrix
%           Note that this is not the matrix that converts the coefficients
%           That's (T_c2r').'
