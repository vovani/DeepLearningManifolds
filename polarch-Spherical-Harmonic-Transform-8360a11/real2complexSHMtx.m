function T_r2c = real2complexSHMtx(N)
%REAL2COMPLEXSHMTX Returns transformation matrix of real to complex SH
%   
%   Returns the unitary transformation matrix T_r2c the expresses the complex  
%   spherical harmonics with respect to the real ones, so that 
%   y_N = T_r2c * r_N, where r_N and y_N are the real and complex SH
%   vectors respectively, with all SHs up to order N included. For
%   normalisations and conventions used here for each base see the README
%   file.

%   T_r2c:  (N+1)^2 x (N+1)^2 basis transformation matrix
%           Note that this is not the matrix that converts the coefficients
%           That's (T_r2c').'
