%CHECKCONDNUMBER  Computes the condition number for a least-squares SHT
%
%   N:  maximum order to be tested for the given set of points
%   dirs:   [azimuth inclination] angles in rads for each evaluation point,

%           theta = pi/2-elevation
%   basisType:  'complex' or 'real' spherical harmonics
%   W:  weights for each measurement point to condition the inversion, in
%       case of a weighted least-squares (Ndirs x 1 vector)
