function C_N = real2complexCoeffs(R_N)
%REAL2COMPLEXCOEFFS Convert SH coeffs from the real to complex basis
%   
%   Converts the vector of (N+1)^2xK SH coefficients of K functions on the
%   real SH base, to the respective ones of the complex SH base. For
%   normalisations and conventions used here for each base see the README
%   file.
