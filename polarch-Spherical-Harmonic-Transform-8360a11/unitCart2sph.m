function [aziElev] = unitCart2sph(xyz)
%UNITCART2SPH Get directly azimuth and elevation from unit vectors
%   Similar to cart2sph, assuming unit vectors and using matrices for the 
%   inputs and outputs, instead of separate vectors of coordinates. More
%   convenient for many of the SH functions found here.
