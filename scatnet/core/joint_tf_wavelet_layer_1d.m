% Description
%   This function builds a scattering layer, which performs two wavelet
%   transform at once : one over the time axis, the other on the
%   log-frequency axis. Henceforth, it is known as joint time-frequency
%   (tf) wavelet layer for 1-d signals. Starting from a scalogram U, it
%   computes a two-dimensional, low-pass filtering U_Phi of U, as well as
%   an array of two-dimensional, band-pass filtering U_Psi is required.
%   This function is called by joint_tf_wavelet_factory_1d and calls
%   wavelet_factory_1d twice, is whch most of the computation is
%   concentrated.
