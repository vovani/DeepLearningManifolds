% SPEC_FREQ_AVERAGE Calulates the frequency-averaged spectrogram
%
% Usage
%    spec = SPEC_FREQ_AVERAGE(x, filters, options)
%
% Input
%    x (numeric): The signal to be transformed.
%    filters (cell): The set of filters used to calculate the spectrogram
%       and the frequency averaging.
%    options (struct): Various options to the function:
%       options.oversampling (int): The amount of oversampling with respect to
%          the critical bandwidth, as a power of 2 (default 1).
%
% Output
%    spec (numeric): The frequency-averaged spectrogram, arranged in as a 
%       first-order scattering transform.
%
% Description
%    First, the spectrogram of x is computed with respect to the second-order
%    lowpass filter filters{2}.phi, if it is present, otherwise filters{1}.phi
%    is used. Once a spectrogram is obtained, the filters in filters{1}.psi are
%    averaged with the spectrogram to each yield a time-varying coefficient.
%    The resulting signals are arranged in spec in the format of a first-order
%    scattering transform. As a result, spec{1}.signal is empty, since no 
%    zeroth-order coefficients are present. However, spec{2}.signal contains 
%    the frequency-averaged spectrogram coefficients, arranged in order of 
%    decreasing frequeny.
%
%    The accompanying meta structure is also analogous to the scattering 
%    transform. Notably, spec{2}.meta.order is equal to 1 for each coefficient
%    and spec{2}.meta.j gives the index of the filter used to compute the
%    frequency averaging.
