% NEXT_FOLD Calculates the next fold in an N-fold cross validation
%
% Usage
%    [train_set, test_set] = NEXT_FOLD(obj_class, train_set, test_set)
%
% Input
%    obj_class (int): The classes of the objects in the database. The sets 
%       train_set and test_set contain indexes of obj_class.
%    train_set (int): The training set of the current fold.
%    test_set (int): The testing set of the current fold.
%
% Output
%    train_set (int): The training set of the next fold.
%    test_set (int): The testing set of the next fold.
%
% Description
%    For each class, NEXT_FOLD extracts its training and testing sets. These 
%    are then permuted so that the old testing set is at the beginning of the
%    new training set and that the end of the old training set becomes the new
%    testing set. For example, if the training and testing sets were divided
%    into blocks of the same size, we have the old sets
%        TRAIN: 1 2 3 4, TEST: 5,
%    the new sets will be
%        TRAIN: 5 1 2 3, TEST: 4.
%    In this way, five-fold cross-validation is obtained by calling NEXT_FOLD
%    four times to cycle through the different folds.
