% SVM_CALC_KERNEL Precalculate SVM kernel
%
% Usage
%    database = SVM_CALC_KERNEL(database, kernel_type, kernel_format, ... 
%       kernel_set)
%
% Input
%    database (struct): The database containing the feature vectors.
%    kernel_type (char): The type of kernel: 'linear', or 'gaussian' (default 
%       'gaussian')
%    kernel_format (char): The format in which to store the kernel: 'square', or 
%       'triangle'. The latter only takes half the space (default 'square').
%    kernel_set (int): The set of indices for which the kernel is computed. 
%       Note that only these are used for training and testing, so if a subset
%       of the full database is chosen, performance might degrade. To manually
%       recalculate the kernel during testing, the full_test_kernel option can
%       be set and passed to svm_train (default 1:size(db.features,2)).
%
% Output
%    database (struct): The input database, with a kernel field added contain-
%       ing the precalculated kernel.
