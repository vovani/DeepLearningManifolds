% CONCATENATE_FREQ Concatenates first frequencies into tables
%
% Usage
%    Y = CONCATENATE_FREQ(X, fmt)
%
% Input
%    X (struct or cell): The scattering layer to process, or a cell array of
%       such scattering layers. Often S or U outputs of SCAT.
%    fmt (char, optional): Either 'table' or 'cell'. Describes how grouped
%       coefficients are assembled. See Description for more details (default
%       'table').
%
% Output
%    Y (struct or cell): The same scattering layers, with all coefficients 
%       that only differ by first frequency lambda1 grouped together.
%
% Description
%    In order to perform operations along frequency, or in the time-frequency
%    plane, scattering coefficients need to be grouped together and concate-
%    nated along the first frequency axis, lambda1. Specifically, all coef-
%    ficients that have the same frequencies lambda2, lambda3, etc are grouped
%    together. For the first order, this means that we only have one group,
%    whereas in the second order, we have one group for each lambda2, and so
%    on.
%
%    Each signal in the input is of the form Nx1xK, where N is the number of
%    time samples and K is the number of signals that are processed simulta-
%    neously. Consider one group as described above, containing P coeffi-
%    cients, with all coefficients having the same number of time samples. 
%    This is the case, for example, when the input X is a scattering transform
%    output S. Here, the coefficients can be concatenated into a single table
%    of dimension NxPxK. If the fmt parameter is set to 'table', this is in-
%    deed what happens. The P coefficients in X are therefore replaced by
%    one table in Y of the dimension described above. If fmt equals 'cell',
%    a cell array is created instead of a table, containing each of the sig-
%    nals in the group. In both cases, frequencies lambda1 are arranged in 
%    order of decreasing frequency (increasing scale).
%
%    To preserve the meta fields of the original coefficients, they are copied
%    into the output structure. They are ordered in order of increasing group
%    index, so that if the first group contains P coefficients, the first
%    P columns of a given meta field corresponds to the coefficients of the 
%    first group, and so on. Within each group, the columns are ordered in 
%    order of decreasing lambda1, just like within the groups themselves.
