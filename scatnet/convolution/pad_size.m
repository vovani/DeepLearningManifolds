% PAD_SIZE Compute the optimal size for padding
%
% Usage
%   sz_padded = PAD_SIZE(sz, min_margin, max_ds)
%
% Input
%   sz (int): The size of the original signal.
%   min_margin (int): The minimum margin for padding.
%   max_ds (int): The maximum downsampling factor.
%
% Output
%   sz_padded (int): The minimum size of the padded signal.
%
% Description
%   Calculates the smallest multiple of 2^max_ds larger than sz by at least 
%   2*min_margin. This ensures that there is enough margin on both sides of
%   the signal to avoid border effects, assuming that min_margin is equal
%   to at least half of the size of the largest filter used, while ensuring
%   that downsampling by powers of 2 up to 2^max_ds are possible through
%   periodization of the Fourier transform.
%   sz_added is also enforced to be at least 1
